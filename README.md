# Hello-World
This is your first repository

I have tried to finish my homework with ncsu github. But there are some unexpected error. So I failed to submit my homework with a private repo which is not free. I first list the repo and branches in any repo. Then I create a repo named hello world with a discription of this is an additional repo for hw1. After that, I create issues and reeditd it. In order to not change any readme. I will change my code repoo = hw1. I do all of these based on repoo = Hello-World.
